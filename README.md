This is a collection of source code used to solve homework problems for courses I took in grad school. I was a total python noob so my code style is evolving throughout, and there are probably a lot of inefficient solutions especially early on. 

These are mostly here for my own reference and to refer students to working (if poor) implementations. Use as reference material at your own risk!
